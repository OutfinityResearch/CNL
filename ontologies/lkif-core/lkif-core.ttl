A legal entity is not necessarily distinct from the natural persons of which it is composed. Most legal entities are simply amalgamations of the persons that make it up for convenience's sake. A legal entity that does have a separate existence from its members is called a company or corporation. This distinction gives the corporation its unique perpetual succession privilege and is usually also the source of the limited liability of corporate members.
