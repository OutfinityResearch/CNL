## Description
FaBiO is an ontology for recording and publishing descriptions of entities that are published or potentially publishable (e.g., journal articles, conference papers, books, datasets). It is compatible with the FRBR (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records) model.

It provides a rich vocabulary for:
- **Publication Types:** Research papers, editorials, blog posts, novels, poems, specifications, algorithms.
- **Bibliographic Metadata:** Structured properties for citations, volumes, issues, and series.

## Usage in CNL
Use FaBiO when your domain involves document management, publishing, or citations:
- **Library Systems:** Categorizing and managing diverse collection types.
- **Academic Knowledge Graphs:** Linking researchers to their outputs (papers, datasets).
- **Content Management:** Distinguishing between different types of written content (e.g., "Review Article" vs. "Research Paper").
