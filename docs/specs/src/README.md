# Source Mirror

## Purpose
This folder mirrors the runtime source tree. Every runtime file has a matching design note with the same relative path plus the `.md` suffix.

## Example Mapping
- Runtime file: `src/parser/grammar.mjs`
- Spec mirror: `docs/specs/src/parser/grammar.mjs.md`

## Status
The runtime source tree is not yet committed. Add mirror files as soon as source modules appear.
