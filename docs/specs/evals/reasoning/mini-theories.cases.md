# evals/reasoning/mini-theories.cases

## Summary
Small end-to-end theories that illustrate typical reasoning tasks (proof, query) using short CNL inputs.

## Notes
- Expectations are placeholders until pragmatic engines are fully implemented.
- Each case uses a compact theory plus a command (verify/return) to show intended behavior.
- Each case includes a `purpose` field to describe what is being tested.
