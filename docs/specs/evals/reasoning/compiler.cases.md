# evals/reasoning/compiler.cases

## Summary
Validation cases for compiler output and KB mutation semantics. These cases are placeholders until execution output formats are finalized.

## Expectations
- Facts compile into KB relations or unary sets.
- Attribute assertions compile into numeric or entity-valued indices.
- BaseDictionary declarations do not insert facts.
