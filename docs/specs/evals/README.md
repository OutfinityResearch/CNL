# Evaluation Suites

## Purpose
Evaluation suites validate end-to-end parsing and reasoning behavior. They are larger than unit tests and focus on expected outcomes and traceability.

## Planned Suites
- `evals/parsing/` - parsing cases with expected AST summaries.
- `evals/reasoning/` - proof and explanation cases.
- `evals/planning/` - action planning scenarios.
- `evals/solve/` - constraint solving scenarios.

## Documentation
Each suite file should have a mirror description in this folder using the same relative path with `.md` appended.
