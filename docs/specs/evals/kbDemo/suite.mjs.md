# evals/kbDemo/suite.mjs

## Summary
Curated demo cases for the KB that exercise query, proof, and explain against small theories.

## Notes
- Inputs are limited to supported CNL grammar forms.
- Each demo uses multi-step rule chains to avoid trivial base-fact proofs.
- Expected outputs are used for demo checks rather than strict assertion matching.
