# Developer Testing Notes

## Purpose
Developer tests capture ad-hoc, exploratory cases during implementation. They are not part of the formal CI suite unless promoted.

## Guidelines
- Keep cases minimal and well labeled.
- Promote stable cases into the unit or evaluation suites.
- Record the intent and expected outcome in the mirror spec file.
