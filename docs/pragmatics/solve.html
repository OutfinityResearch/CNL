        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>
          The <strong>Solve</strong> pragmatic treats the CNL input as a <strong>Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)</strong>. It is used when you don't know <em>who</em> or <em>what</em> fits, but you know the <em>rules</em> they must follow.
        </p>

        <h2>Syntax</h2>
        <div class="code-block">
<pre>
Solve for every schedule such that every task is assigned to a user
and every user has the skill for the task
and no user has more than 5 tasks.
</pre>
        </div>

        <h2>Execution Logic</h2>
        <p>
          The compiler identifies the variables (<code>schedule</code>, <code>task</code>, <code>user</code>) and the constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. <strong>Domain Definition:</strong> <code>user</code> is the set of all users in KB. <code>task</code> is the set of tasks.
          <br>2. <strong>Constraint Propagation:</strong> "user has skill" filters the domain of possible assignments.
          <br>3. <strong>Solver Backend:</strong> The problem is often handed off to an SMT solver (like Z3) or a backtracking solver to find a valid assignment matrix.
