        <h1>Pragmatic Separation of Intent</h1>
        <p>Decoupling the "What" from the "How": using a single language to drive queries, proofs, plans, and constraints.</p>

        <h2>Representation vs. Intent</h2>
        <p>
          In traditional programming, syntax is tied to execution. An SQL <code>SELECT</code> statement is always a query. A Python <code>assert</code> is always a check.
        </p>
        <p>
          CNL-PL operates on a different theory: <strong>The text describes a state of the world</strong>. What we <em>do</em> with that description is a separate layer called <strong>Pragmatics</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider the phrase: <em>"The container is secure."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a representation of a fact. Depending on the pragmatic mode ("command") wrapping it, the meaning changes entirely:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Query Mode:</strong> Is the container secure right now? (Read operation)</li>
          <li><strong>Assert Mode:</strong> Update the database to mark the container as secure. (Write operation)</li>
          <li><strong>Constraint Mode:</strong> Ensure the container is <em>always</em> secure. (Invariant definition)</li>
          <li><strong>Plan Mode:</strong> Perform necessary actions (like encryption) to <em>make</em> the container secure. (Goal definition)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Unified Frontend</h2>
        <p>
          The theoretical benefit of this separation is that users only need to learn one way to describe the world. They don't need a separate "Query Language", "Constraint Language", and "Planning Language". They learn the SVO structure and boolean logic once, and apply it everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          This unification extends to the internal architecture. The compiler produces the same Intermediate Representation (Plan IR) regardless of the pragmatic. A <code>SetPlan</code> describing "secure containers" is identical whether it's being used to filter a list or to validate a compliance rule.
        </p>

        <h2>Engines as Backends</h2>
        <p>
          Pragmatics effectively act as "drivers" for different execution engines.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>Solver Engine</strong> treats the AST as a set of logical constraints (SAT/SMT) and tries to find variable assignments. The <strong>Planner Engine</strong> treats the AST as a goal state and searches the action space. The <strong>Proof Engine</strong> treats the AST as a theorem and searches the deduction space.
        </p>
        <p>
          This modularity makes CNL-PL extensible. New pragmatics (e.g., "Optimize" or "Simulate") can be added by implementing new backends that consume the standard Plan IR, without changing the core language syntax.
