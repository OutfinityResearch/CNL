// Spatial containment
Rule: If X is inside Y and Y is inside Z, then X is inside Z.

// Location and containment
Rule: If X is inside Y, then X is located in Y.

// Adjacency symmetry
Rule: If X is adjacent to Y, then Y is adjacent to X.

// Spatial exclusion (basic)
Rule: If X is inside Y and Z is inside Y and X is adjacent to Z, then X is not inside Z.
