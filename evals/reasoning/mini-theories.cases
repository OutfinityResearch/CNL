# Reasoning Mini-Theory Cases

- input: "Server1 handles Payments.\nRule: If Server1 handles Payments, then Server1 is encrypted.\nVerify that Server1 is encrypted."
  purpose: "Forward rule: binary fact implies unary membership."
  expect: "true"
  trace: "proof trace placeholder"
- input: "Truck_A is a truck.\nTruck_A has a capacity of 1000.\nReturn the name of every truck whose capacity is greater than 500."
  purpose: "Query with unary base set and numeric filter."
  expect: "Truck_A"
- input: "User1 is a user.\nUser2 is a user.\nUser1 has a role of Admin.\nUser2 has a role of Guest.\nReturn the name of every user whose role is Admin."
  purpose: "Query with entity-valued attribute filter."
  expect: "User1"
- input: "Task1 is assigned to Worker1.\nTask2 is assigned to Worker2.\nVerify that Task1 is assigned to Worker1."
  purpose: "Direct proof of a binary relation."
  expect: "true"
- input: "Package1 is a package.\nPackage2 is a package.\nPackage1 is delivered.\nPackage2 is delivered.\nVerify that every package that is delivered is delivered."
  purpose: "Universal proof via subset check."
  expect: "true"
