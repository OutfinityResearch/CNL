# Reasoning Mini-Theory Cases

- input: "Server1 is a machine.\nServer1 handles payments.\nEvery machine that handles payments is a server.\nEvery server that handles payments is critical.\nEvery server that is critical is encrypted.\nVerify that Server1 is encrypted."
  purpose: "Multi-step rule chain from relation to unary."
  expect: "true"
  trace: "proof trace placeholder"
- input: "Truck_A is a truck.\nTruck_A has a capacity of 1000.\nEvery truck whose capacity is greater than 500 is heavy.\nEvery truck that is heavy is insured.\nReturn the name of every truck that is insured."
  purpose: "Query with numeric filter feeding a rule chain."
  expect: "Truck_A"
- input: "--- CONTEXT: BaseDictionary ---\n\"role\" is an \"entity attribute\".\n--- CONTEXT: Core ---\nUser1 is a user.\nUser2 is a user.\nUser1 has a role of admin.\nUser2 has a role of guest.\nEvery user whose role is equal to admin is privileged.\nEvery user that is privileged is audited.\nReturn the name of every user that is audited."
  purpose: "Query with entity-valued attribute rule chain."
  expect: "User1"
- input: "Task1 is a work-item.\nTask1 is assigned to Worker1.\nEvery work-item is a task.\nEvery task that is assigned to Worker1 is priority-task.\nEvery priority-task is queued.\nVerify that Task1 is queued."
  purpose: "Proof with relation-based rule chain."
  expect: "true"
- input: "Package1 is a package.\nPackage1 is delivered.\nEvery package that is delivered is verified.\nEvery package that is verified is archived.\nVerify that every package that is delivered is archived."
  purpose: "Universal proof over a two-step rule chain."
  expect: "true"
