# Query Evaluation Cases

- input: "--- CONTEXT: BaseDictionary ---\n\"role\" is an entity attribute.\n--- CONTEXT: Core ---\nUser1 is a user.\nUser1 has a role of Admin.\nEvery user whose role is equal to Admin is privileged.\nEvery user that is privileged is audited.\nReturn the name of every user that is audited."
  purpose: "Query with derived unary predicate from entity-valued attribute rule chain."
  expect: "User1"
- input: "Server1 is a machine.\nServer1 handles Payments.\nEvery machine that handles Payments is a server.\nEvery server that handles Payments is critical.\nReturn the name of every server that is critical."
  purpose: "Query with derived unary predicate from relation-based rules."
  expect: "Server1"
- input: "--- CONTEXT: BaseDictionary ---\n\"capacity\" is a numeric attribute.\n--- CONTEXT: Core ---\nTruck_A is a truck.\nTruck_A has a capacity of 1000.\nTruck_A is located at Warehouse_1.\nEvery truck whose capacity is greater than 500 and that is located at Warehouse_1 is eligible.\nEvery truck that is eligible is insured.\nReturn the name of every truck that is insured."
  purpose: "Query with numeric+relation filters feeding a derived predicate chain."
  expect: "Truck_A"
