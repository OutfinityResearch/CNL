# Simulation Evaluation Cases

- input: "SmokeSensor is a sensor.\nEvery sensor that detects smoke is critical.\nEvery sensor that is critical is monitored.\nWhen the sensor detects smoke occurs, then the alarm is active.\nSimulate 2 steps."
  purpose: "Simulation with rule chain and transition rule."
  expect: "steps=2"
