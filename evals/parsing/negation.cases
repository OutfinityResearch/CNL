# Parsing Evaluation Cases for Negation

- input: "X is not valid."
  purpose: "Parse simple negation with copula."
  expect: {"count":1,"negations":[{"kind":"CopulaPredicateAssertion","complement":"valid"}]}

- input: "Rule: If X is not valid, then X is rejected."
  purpose: "Parse negation in rule antecedent."
  expect: {"count":1,"negations":[{"kind":"CopulaPredicateAssertion","complement":"valid"}]}

- input: "every contract that is not signed is pending."
  purpose: "Parse negation in relative clause."
  expect: {"count":1,"negations":[{"kind":"RelCopulaPredicate","complement":"signed"}]}

- input: "Rule: If X permits Y, then Y is not prohibited by X."
  purpose: "Parse negation in rule consequent (passive)."
  expect: {"count":1,"negations":[{"kind":"PassiveRelationAssertion","verb":"prohibited","preposition":"by"}]}
