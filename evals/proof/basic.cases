# Proof Evaluation Cases

- input: "Server1 is a machine.\nServer1 handles Payments.\nEvery machine that handles Payments is a server.\nEvery server that handles Payments is critical.\nEvery server that is critical is encrypted.\nVerify that Server1 is encrypted."
  purpose: "Proof over a multi-step rule chain."
  expect: "true"
- input: "Package1 is a package.\nPackage1 is delivered.\nEvery package that is delivered is verified.\nEvery package that is verified is archived.\nVerify that every package that is delivered is archived."
  purpose: "Universal proof over a rule chain."
  expect: "true"
- input: "User1 is a member.\nUser1 logs in today.\nEvery member is a user.\nEvery user that logs in today is active.\nEvery user that is active is trusted.\nVerify that User1 is trusted."
  purpose: "Proof over a relation + unary rule chain."
  expect: "true"
